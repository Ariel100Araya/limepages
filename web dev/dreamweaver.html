        <h5>Adobe Dreamweaver is the standard when it comes to web design, most websites use it to program their sites and make them look nice. A very good example of a site made by Adobe Dreamweaver would be House and Garden (<a href="https://houseandgarden.co.uk">houseandgarden.co.uk</a>). This website used its Grid feature to design a "newspaper" site.</h5>
